    <h2>Brief History</h2>

    <p>
       In the 19th century Manchester grew dramatically on the wealth created by cotton.
       The city’s amazing Victorian civic buildings, mills and factories shout ‘This is Manchester. We’ve arrived’.
    </p>

    <p>
       Alongside innovation in industry has been an intellectual vigour. From the Manchester School to the radical politics of the suffragettes,
       Manchester has been the birthplace of new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
       Friedrich Engels wrote his <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844</em> while living in Manchester.
       Fittingly, archaeologists discovered the remains of a club frequented by Engels when laying the foundations for the University’s national institute for graphene
       – the wonder material that won our researchers Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov a Nobel Prize.
     </p>

     <p>
       The city has undergone extensive rejuvenation since the late 1990s and in 2002 it hosted the Commonwealth Games.
       Sport is part of Manchester’s cultural fabric, with its football teams among the most famous in the world and the
       National Football Museum welcoming visitors to the city as they disembark at Victoria Station.

    <h2>Notable Monuments</h2>
    <h5>The Alan Turing Memorial, situated in Sackville Park in Manchester.</h5>
    <img src="images/turing.jpg" alt="Alan Turing Memorial" title="Alan Turing Memorial" width="60%">
    <p>
      Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher,
      and theoretical biologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of
      the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
      Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country, if only because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
    </p>

    <h5>The Queen Victoria Statue, located in Piccadilly Gardens</h5>
    <img src="images/queen.jpg" alt="Queen Victoria Statue" title="Queen Victoria Statue" width="60%" height="370px">
    <p>
      A large statue of the United Kingdom's longest serving monarch sits proudly in the centre of Piccadilly Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
       Queen Victoria reigned over the country from 1837 to 1901.
       Sculptor Edward Onslow Ford was commissioned to create the tribute to Victoria, with the Queen agreeing to sit for the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
       Unfortunately the bronze statue of the throned Victoria was not unveiled until 10 months after her death in 1901.
       An inscription reads: 'Erected by the citizens of Manchester in 1901 to commemorate the completion in 1897 of the sixtieth year of her reign'
       It adds: 'Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares'.
    </p>

    <h5>The Victory over Blindness Monument, located on Piccadilly Approach outside the main entrance of Manchester Piccadilly station</h5>
    <img src="images/blind.jpg" alt="Victory over Blindness Monument" title="Victory over Blindness Monument" width="60%" height="370px">
    <p>
      The sculpture depicts seven blind figures guiding each other and walking together;
      their likeness are based upon real veterans who all suffered blindness as a result of action on the frontline.
      Blind Veterans UK commissioned the sculptor Johanna Domke-Guyot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was commissioned by the Blind Veterans UK and was unveiled in October 2018.
      It is believed to be the only memorial to depict those wounded in the First World War.
